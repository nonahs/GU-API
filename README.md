# GU-API
IMX Market listing

Uses the Immutable X API to get data on the last 100 items listed on the IMX market. Can be set to auto-refresh, show/hide eth listings and show/hide sold items. Set to only show Gods Unchained cards but can also show any items listed on the marketplace. Currently supports IMX/GODS/ETH currencies.

### TODO
